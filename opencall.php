  <p>OPEN CALL OCTOBER 2017 <br>
    I KNEW YOU BEFORE I MET YOU <br>
    CURATED BY JESSICA PETRYLAK <br>
  </p>

  <p>THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM APPS ARE PROGRESSIVELY CRAFTING A NEW WAY OF
    COMMUNICATING OUR IDEAS AND INNER SELF. THE PROJECTION OF IMAGES AND
    CONCEPTS CAN REACH AROUND THE WORLD QUICKLY AND WITH EASE. FOR THE ARTIST,
    MODERN-DAY INVOLVEMENT IN SOCIAL NETWORKING AND MEDIA COMMUNICATION
    REVITALIZES AND RENEWS THE EXPERIENCE OF INTERCONNECTING, SHARING AND MAKING
    ART. THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS BROUGHT UP ABOUT DIARISTIC OVERSHARING, THE
    LEGITIMACY OF ART MADE ONLY FOR INTERNET VIEWING, AND HOW THE DIGITAL
    CONTENT WILL BE DISPLAYED/SOLD IN A TRADITIONAL GALLERY SETTING.
